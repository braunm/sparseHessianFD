Replication instructions for sparseHessianFD

There are two replication code files:

1. code-section-2.R: runs the code that is included in the article in Section 2.
2. code-section-4.R: code to replicate Figure 4 and Table 4 in Section 4.

The code in file 2 may take a long time to run.  As written, the
objects tab4 and fig4 are not saved to a file.  If you want to retain
the output, you should edit the code accordingly.
