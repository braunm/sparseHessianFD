\name{color_graph}
\alias{color_graph}
\usage{
color_graph(pntr, idx, nvars, LT = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pntr,idx}{row pointers and column indices (CSC or
  CSR format; same since Hessian matrix is symmetric). Must
  use zero-based indexing.}

  \item{nvars}{Dimension of Hessian (number of variables)}

  \item{LT}{true (default) if ordering with degree in lower
  triangle, and false if using full Hessian.  Included only
  for testing, to see if it matters (I don't think it
  does).}
}
\value{
A list.  Each element of the list represents a color, and
contains an integer vector with the indices of the
variables with that color.  Indices are zero-based.
}
\description{
Generate valid cyclic coloring of variables that is
consistent with estimating sparse Hessian with a triangle
substitution method.
